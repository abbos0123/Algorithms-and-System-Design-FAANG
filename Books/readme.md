## Introduction 
Data structures and algorithms are the fundamentals of software development. The study of data structures and algorithms involves a lot of thinking ability and exercise of the brain. From many big tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc to the new emerging startups like Zomato, Swiggy, etc, all have interview rounds based on data structures and algorithms. Since Data structures and Algorithms are so important, not just for the hiring processes but also for the development of Problem Solving Skills of a developer, it is very important to know about the best resources to study them. This repository focuses on some of the best books on Data structures and Algorithms.
