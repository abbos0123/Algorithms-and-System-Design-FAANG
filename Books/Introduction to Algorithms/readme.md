## Introduction to Algorithms 

This book is often said to be the bible for Algorithms. The book has a lot of famous algorithms ranging from a variety of topics like Dynamic Programming, Greedy methods, to various advanced Graph Algorithms and even Multithreaded Algorithms, algorithms related to Number Theory and what not. 

The book is famous by the name of CLRS Book on Algorithms.

However, this book is not that beginner-friendly. So, if you are a complete beginner to the world of data structures and algorithms, this book might not be the right one for you but it is a really good book for your future read. The book is highly recommended even in Colleges and Universities. This is surely one of the best books for Algorithms.
